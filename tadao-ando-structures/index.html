He was born in osaka, and studied architecture through the in situ of european, american and japanese models observation. Tadao ando&#39;s body of work is known for the creative use of natural light and for structures that follow natural forms of the landscape, rather than disturbing the landscape by making it conform to the constructed space of a building. Tadao now focuses mainly on bigger structures, such as galleries or exhibition halls, due to his ability to create a public space where humans can communicate and gather in numbers. He is best known for his minimalist concrete buildings.
