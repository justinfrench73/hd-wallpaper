Central wood design fireplace with open hearth JULIETTA 985 JC BORDELET From bordelet.com
Made entirely of glass and stainless steel, the igloo is a sleek and modern update to the traditional fireplace. Our exclusive and expensive fireplaces are the most visually stunning fireplace designs available. Central fireplaces are usually located in the center of a room or near corners, and are often use to create a separation, for example between a living and dinning area, or in a larger room. Their designs are rather minimalist for the most part, adding a creative and stunning accent to contemporary interior.
