<p>For more than 15 years, we've been helping people like you build pool cabanas throughout canada, north america and beyond. The concept for the new pool house was to incorporate the vocabulary of these. For our small inground vinyl pool kits, we have done small pool sizes of 10’x10′, 8’x24′, and even 12’x18′, but can do nearly any size and shape.
